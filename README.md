## General Information

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Prep Time:** 45 minutes
- **Cook Time:** 1 hour
- **Total Time:** Approximately 7.75 hours (includes cooling time)

## Ingredients

### For Graham Cracker Crust

- 1 and 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (about 10 full sheet graham crackers)
- 5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar

### For Cheesecake Filling

- Four 8-ounce blocks (904g) full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (240g) full-fat sour cream, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (optional but recommended)
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- Topping suggestions: salted caramel, lemon curd, strawberry topping, chocolate ganache, red wine chocolate ganache, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or raspberry sauce (recipe in notes)

## Instructions

1. Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C).

2. **Making the Graham Cracker Crust:**

   - Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour them into a medium bowl and stir in the sugar and melted butter until combined. The mixture will be sandy.
   - Press the mixture firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. Greasing the pan is not necessary. You can use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly.
   - Bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will be used for the water bath in step 4. Allow the crust to cool slightly as you prepare the filling.

3. **Making the Cheesecake Filling:**

   - Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together in a large bowl on medium-high speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.
   - Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice (if desired), then beat until fully combined.
   - At medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. Avoid over-mixing the batter to prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools.

4. **Preparing the Water Bath:**

   - Boil a pot of water. You'll need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure to boil enough water. You can use a kettle of hot water for convenience.
   - While the water is heating up, wrap the springform pan with aluminum foil to prevent water from entering. Pour the cheesecake batter over the pre-baked crust.

5. **Baking the Cheesecake:**

   - Bake the cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. You'll know it's done when the center of the cheesecake slightly wobbles when you gently shake the pan.
   - Turn off the oven and open the oven door slightly. Allow the cheesecake to sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools for 1 hour. Then, remove it from the oven and the water bath, and let it cool completely at room temperature.
   - Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.

6. **Serving the Cheesecake:**
   - Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. For clean slices, wipe the knife clean and dip it in warm water between each slice.
   - Serve the cheesecake with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!
